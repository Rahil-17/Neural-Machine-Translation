Its an implementation of idea proposed by the paper 
Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate
-Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, Yoshua Bengio 

Model is built using Seq2Seq model with Attention Mechanism. The Encoders and Decoders are designed using Recurrent Neural Networks with GRU. PyTorch framework is used to implement the models.
